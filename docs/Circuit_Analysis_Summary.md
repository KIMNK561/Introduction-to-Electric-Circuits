## Energy Absorption & Supply in Circuit Elements

Whether a circuit element **absorbs** or **supplies** energy depends on the **reference direction of voltage** with respect to the direction of current.

## Sign of Voltage Across a Resistor: Role of Reference Direction and Current Flow

The voltage across a resistor depends on the reference direction of voltage and the direction of current.

Combining this with the concept of energy absorption and supply in circuit elements, we can conclude that a resistor with positive resistance always absorbs energy, regardless of the reference directions of voltage and current.
