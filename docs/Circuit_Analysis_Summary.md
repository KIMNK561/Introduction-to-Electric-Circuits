## Energy Absorption & Supply in Circuit Elements

Whether a circuit element **absorbs** or **supplies** energy depends on the **reference direction of voltage** with respect to the direction of current.

## Voltage Sign in Resistors

The voltage across a resistor depends on the reference direction of voltage and the direction of current.

Combining the energy absorption in circuit elements and voltage sign in resistors, we can conclude:

> ðŸ’¡ **A resistor with positive resistance always absorbs energy, regardless of the reference directions of voltage and current.**

## Design Using Op-Amp

To design with operational amplifiers, it is helpful to **memorize common configurations** that relate input(s) to output based on the desired signal behavior.
