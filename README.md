# Introduction to Electric Circuits â€“ Review Log

This repository documents my personal review of the textbook  
**"Introduction to Electric Circuits (9th Edition)" by Richard C. Dorf and James A. Svoboda.**

Each chapter is organized into its own folder and contains `.txt` files listing only the problem numbers I found challenging.  
I revisit these problems in multiple attempts to reinforce understanding of fundamental circuit concepts through repetition and self-testing.  
No problem content is reproduced; only references by chapter and problem number are included.

## Study Method

1. Solve all end-of-chapter problems from the textbook.
2. List only the problems I could not solve without help.
3. Reattempt the problems in the next attempt.
4. Record which ones remain unclear or are resolved.
5. Repeat this process to strengthen understanding.
