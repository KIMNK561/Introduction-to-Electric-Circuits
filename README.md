# Introduction to Electric Circuits â€“ Review Log

This repository tracks my personal review process for the textbook  
**"Introduction to Electric Circuits" by Richard C. Dorf and James A. Svoboda.**

It focuses on identifying practice problems that I struggled with and organizing them by chapter and review attempt. Only problem numbers are listed; no problem content is reproduced. The goal is to reinforce understanding of core circuit concepts through repeated self-testing and targeted review.

## Study Method

1. Solve all problems from the textbook.
2. List only the problems I could not solve without help.
3. Reattempt those problems at a later date.
4. Keep track of which problems I resolved and which still remain unclear.
5. Repeat until fully confident in all core problem types.
